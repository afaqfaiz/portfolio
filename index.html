        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Chess Game</h3>
            <p>I developed a fully functional chess game using C++ as a console-based project.
                 The entire code was written from scratch, implementing the core mechanics of chess, 
                 including piece movement, rules, and game flow. This project helped me deepen my understanding of
                  object-oriented programming, algorithmic thinking, and game logic.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Client-Server Program</h3>
            <p>I created a console-based client-server program in C, where the client sends encrypted data to the server.
                 The server securely stores the data without decrypting it. I also implemented a mechanism to download
                  and decrypt the stored data, allowing for secure data transmission and retrieval. This project strengthened 
                my understanding of network programming, encryption techniques, and secure data handling.</p>

                responsive and visually appealing websites. The course also covered web design principles, 
                mobile-first development, and user interface design, helping me enhance both the 
                functionality and aesthetics of web projects.</p>
